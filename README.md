# Chatbot-using-RNN-and-NLP

In this project, we design  and train a basic rule based model that chats with humans based on NLP.
To achieve this we use Neural Network. In particular, we use RNN after processing and cleaning the data.
This project was run on Amazon SageMaker, using S3 buckets for storage.

The dataset used for this project  is the intents.json file that contains
words and corresponding responses as key-value pairs in json file.

# RUN:
